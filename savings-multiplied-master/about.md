#Savings Multiplied

##By: Marsie Thomas

###A Story: About how I created Savings Multiplied.

I used lots of tables. I'm sure there is a better way

to do this. However, I found them so easy to modify.

The page looks perfect on my computer. However, it will probably look ridiculous

on a larger screen or mobile device.


##Things left to do on the home page:


1. Put the finishing touches on the seach icon.
1. Add Dark Teal background.
1. There's something else, that I forget.
1. I wish I could remember No. 3. I feel like it was important.



+ *_I will start working on the auction page today_*
+ I will also read about markdown text, too.
